# Memory Game

[Open it here.](https://anapgsilva.github.io/memory_game/)

### This is the first online game I ever built!!!!

This project was built as part of the pre-course work for the Software Enginnering Immersive course at General Assembly Sydney.

It was only written in HTML, CSS and Javascript - with DOM manipulation in Vanilla JS.

Really enjoyed doing it. In particular, coding all the game logic and the details of not letting the player pick more cards after winning or losing, as well as keeping track of the score.

### GAME INSTRUCTIONS

Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
